# Dynamics-Calulations
These programs are used to calculate dynamics of glass-forming liquids. If you have some questions about these programs, you can contact to kangheng921117@163.com
Note: Many guys could have some troubles in calculations of dynamics of glass-forming liquids, such as Self scattering function, Mean square displacement, Non-Guassin, Relaxation time and Diffusion coefficient. You can figure out these problems when using these programs.
Our programs is only for users of LAMMPS. If you are not users of LAMMPS, there could be many troubles because of wrong data format.
