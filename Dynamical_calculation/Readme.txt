notes:

Before the calculation of dynamics, we should write the file of input-DP.txt.

input-DP.txt:
1.first line is: minmum temperature, maxmum temperature and the interval of temperature.
2.second line is : the first peak of "sq" of the element 1.
3.third line is : the first peak of "sq" of the element 2.
4.forth line is : the first peak of "sq" of the total.

if we wanna to get the first peak of "sq" we can calculate the static structure factor by pdf.f90.

Then, we can complie the code of pdt.f90 in linux computer. and calculate the dynamics of systems.
